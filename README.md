# Hi, I'm Andrew

I'm incredibly excited to start working together. I am quite excited you are a part of the team! While this document is not intended to replace personal interactions and developing mutual understandings as we work together. I do hope that is helpful in giving you an idea about how I think, prefer to work, and my hope(s) for you. I intend for this document to be living and breathing. If something seems off or different let me know or open a pull request. I did write this after all, so it can't be perfect üòà . Lastly, these types of READMEs have [received some criticism](https://medium.com/@marcusblankenship/burn-your-manager-readme-a8bfab7b9d8f). I think the criticisms are valid. I intend not to ask you to do the work to make our relationship work, nor adjust your core beliefs to align with mine. My only intent is to put myself out in the open and spark conversation.

## Our average week

We will always have a weekly one on one meeting at the same time, unless there is a P0 issue or one of us is on vacation, for at least 30 minutes. This meeting will serve as time to go over topics deeper than standup or a flyby in the kitchen. I intend to talk about things of _substance_ during these conversations such as career goals, things you may want done differently, or comments and concerns about the team. All of that being said, this is **your time** and we can spend it how you see fit! It is as much up to you as it is to me to have topics ready for these meetings because I do not plan on canceling or skipping them. Lets make sure to hold each other accountable to this goal. There will also be daily standups and a weekly team check in.

## My Personal and Team Values

- **People first** - I believe that an organization is only as strong as its people. My highest priority will always be to invest in you and the team. You will do your best work when you are happy, safe, and challenged. The most rewarding parts of my job is to understand your ["hoodie"](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/managing-nerds/) plus your ["cave"](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/a-nerd-in-a-cave/) and provide it.
- **Everyone is important** - This can be taken many ways. Our customers matter, and they should be our guiding star. Our teammates matter, and we should strive to learn from them as well as show up for them. The rest of the company matters, and we should always be aware of how our decisions may affect them. Lastly, you matter. Always make sure to take time for yourself. That can mean personal development initiatives, time off, or a walk around the park on a beautiful day.
- **Trust** - When I think of trust at work, I think of a team member taking on a piece of work and I know it be done thoughtfully and delivered on time. Additionally, this trust is a two way street. I want you to feel that I trust you and feel that you have the _autonomy_ to explore the problem and achieve the result in a way you see fit without needing to seek my approval or validation. You are always welcome to ask for help or a second set of eyes, but I want you to know that I trust you to accomplish the goal.
- **Honest** - There is no trust without honesty. We will not be able to achieve that relationship without first being completely honest with each other. This can be about what is going on in your life, what is happening in the company, or just the timeline of a project. I intend to be as transparent as possible with all things, and ask that you try the same.
- **Always be shipping** - I think there is compounding value in constantly shipping incremental improvements to our codebase. This can be refactors, optimizations, feature work, or bug fixes. Without shipping constantly, the team loses perceived momentum. This can lead to low morale and creativity.
- **Challenge the Status Quo** - I hope to never accept a pattern or do something "because that is the way we do things". I expect myself and our team to always be asking "why?". Sometimes the answer is sound and apparent, but this approach will help uncover the times it is not and we will all be better for it. This applies to our code, our team processes, and also organizational structure.
- **This should be fun** - Like I said before, we do our best work when we are happy. If you are not enjoying your work we should talk about how we can enjoy your work again. Sometimes this could be a new project, new direction, or more learning. It could also be more work from home time or time and space to exercise. Lets figure out what it is for you!

## What Success looks like in a Member of our Team

A successful member of our team exhibits the above qualities but also proactively challenges themselves and others. They feel ownership of their code, domain, and company. Therefore, they strive to leave things better than they found them and are constantly learning to improve themselves and those around them through mentorship and communication. Their curiosity leads to contributions throughout the company in whichever domains they're interested in. Curiosity helps drive individual growth, for example, curiosity can be followed to new responsibility. For example, if there is something that you see me doing that you are interested in - ask about it! I would be happy to explain what I am doing and if it makes sense transfer that responsibility to you!

Lastly, but most importantly, our team members are kind and caring for those on the team.

## My Work Style

### Work/Life Balance and Schedule

- I like to start early. That does not mean I am a morning person ‚òï Ô∏èü•± by any means but it is usually time I find myself uninterrupted. I cherish my time before 10 am every day and try to keep it free if possible. It also does not mean you have to be online early.
- My headphones are usually on. That does not mean I do not want to be disturbed, I happen to work best that way and enjoy music. I may not see you or hear you coming and therefore may be startled. So sometimes a tap on the shoulder could be replaced by a quick slack if you cannot get my attention and I'll be ready to chat in no time.
- Take vacation, even if it is a day here or there, or an hour in the middle of the day to go for a walk, a run, or get a coffee.
- I may work late and infrequently on weekends. I expect you to set your own hours without feeling like you need to work mine. Furthermore, I trust you will get your work done, and can work accordingly.
- Take time at work to pursue things that are interesting to you that may be off our critical path. Let's find time to talk about finding those opportunities for you and the space to pursue them.
- Please, please, please take vacation.

### Communication

My calendar is always up to date. Please add time to it if you would like, I am always happy to meet formally or informally. I attempt to block all my meetings together. This is usually a double edged sword as provides more time to focus, but can leave me fatigued by the end of the day.

When communicating I prefer to use the following mediums in this order:

- In person/Over video - but lets make sure the time is convenient for both of us. If it is not convenient for you I will make sure to find time that fits your schedule or workload.
- In a meeting
- Over slack - I think long slack threads can be helpful for future context, but in the moment decision making or collaboration is best served via a vide call or in person discussion. I strive to take long slack threads and turn them into real conversations with a recap in slack later.

I will do my best to never slack/email you after working hours or over the weekend. If I do, please do not feel pressure to respond. I know that is a tall ask, because I would feel that pressure. However, I do mean it and will strive to not put you in that situation.

### Feedback

I am always hungry for feedback on what I can do better. I also enjoy praise, but because I don't know how to accept it well - and want to be better for the team - I appreciate hearing about ways I can **improve** even more. Delivery of this feedback in public or private is fine by me, the only thing I ask is that it is done sooner rather than later!

When I deliver feedback I will make sure to understand your preferred method of receiving it. With those preferences in mind, I will also strive to deliver feedback frequently and rapidly after an event that merits comment. Lastly, I will be honest about how I think you are doing, and I only ask that you trust that what I say is always with your best interest in mind.

### How I like to Collaborate

- I find a great joy in brainstorming a solution together. It can be exhilarating to come to a realization at the same time or watch the light bulb go on for someone else. However, when the lightbulb goes on for me, I may get lost in my thoughts. Ask me to come back to Earth, slow down, and explain.
- I always want to pair program more, and am happy to drive or come along for the ride. I also love pairing with different levels of engineers. I always find I learn something when I am pairing no matter if the person is more senior or more junior. It can be new syntax, a workflow technique, a tool or application, something about them , or a software pattern I haven't encountered before.
- Code review as an educational tool. Similarly to pair programming, I believe code review should be done by all levels of engineers and always results in leveling up both parties. These areas of learning are not always code, it can be mentorship, communication, and leadership as well!

### How I make Decisions

I like to make everyone happy. This can be difficult when making decisions. I understand that I cannot make everyone happy at all times, and in attempting to do so this can do more harm than good. That being said I do try to ensure that Io weigh the costs and benefits to all parties involved. It can also lead to me taking a little bit longer to make decisions, it is also something I am working on.

### When Things Go Wrong

Things will go wrong. That is a fact and while unfortunate it is okay. When something does go south, all I ask is that we quickly diagnose what happened, and find a solution. This can be a fix, a rollback, a status page, or a tough conversation with a teammate. Only afterwards should we retro what happened, then find ways to ensure it doesn't happen again. At no point should we assign blame, there is absolutely no benefit in doing that. My only other ask is that you appraise me of the situation at the appropriate time. That can be during an incident, or afterwards if it makes sense. I will also never assign blame, only look at ways to improve in the future.

## What makes Andrew Andrew

### Pet peeves

- I prefer action to talking. I've been in too many meetings that do not provide value. There is a time and a place to debate potential directions or approaches but I bias towards figuring something out by doing.
- Complacency. To use a tired analogy - I look at growth like a shark. Most sharks cannot continue to live without continuing to swim (Except for a few. If you're interested we should talk about buccal pumping sometime). Similarly, without pushing your boundaries and constantly making yourself uncomfortable you will not grow. It is my job to help you with this, but I also expect it to be largely driven by you, too.
- Negative comments or body language. If something or someone is bothering you lets talk about it. If there is something going on outside of work that is okay! Lets figure out how to balance it with your current responsibilities.

### Things I am Working On

- Once you get to know me, you will call me a liar when I say I am an introvert. However, in larger groups or with people I am not as familiar with I can be quiet and shy. I am doing my best to be more comfortable in these types of situations. If you notice I am quiet in a larger group I am most likely trying to gather my bearings, I would always appreciate a lifeline in those settings!
- Balancing planning ahead with the team's current workload and the organizations current priorities. I tend to focus on the now and am working on ensuring the team is always has meaningful work to accomplish.
- See above about decision making.
- I am constantly struggling with an imposter syndrome that is perpetually moving my set of goal posts. While I don't know if this will go away, it is getting better.
- My typing skills. My school district growing up voted for budget cuts and the typing program went. I'm working on it I promise.
- Giving critical feedback. See the above section about decision making. I like making people happy. However, just like the shark I previously mentioned, not giving this feedback can stagnate your growth and it is my job to foster your continued growth. This is something that I am always trying to improve.
- Use of the words "obviously" and "just". Not everything is obvious to everyone and the word "just" can belittle the significance of an action or event for someone.
- Not eating as many skittles.
- There will be times where I go heads down and work on tasks that might tedious or uninteresting. Currently, I think it is helpful for me to handle this work to shield the team and provide them their cave. Ultimately that is wrong and could eventually be detrimental, which is why it is an area of improvement.

### Etc

- I grew up outside of Boston, went to school in central PA (where i wanted to be a doctor üò¨), worked in the Northeast Kingdom of New Hampshire, and now live in New York. My family is usually in Texas or Rhode Island and my wife's family is from New Jersey. Hopefully this explains something about me, though I'm not sure what it might be.
- I like to use vim but also VS Code.
- More often than not I'd like to be surfing
- Have you heard of EmberJS üôÉüêπ
