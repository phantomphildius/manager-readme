# Hi, I'm Andrew

I'm incredibly excited to start working together. I am quite excited you are a part of the team! While this document is not intended to replace personal interactions and developing mutual understandings as we work together. I do hope that is helpful in giving you an idea about how I think, prefer to work, and my hope(s) for you. I intend for this document to be living and breathing. If something seems off or different let me know or open a pull request. I did write this after all, so it can't be perfect üòà

## Our average week

We will always have a weekly one on one meeting at the same time, unless there is a P0 issue or one of us is on vacation, for at least 30 minutes. This meeting will serve as time to go over topics deeper than standup or a flyby in the kitchen. I intend to talk about things of _substance_ during these conversations. It is as much up to you as it is to me to have topics ready for these meetings because I do not plan on canceling or skipping them. Lets make sure to hold each other accountable to this goal. There will also be daily standups and a weekly team check in.

## My Personal and Team Values

- _People first_ - I believe that an organization is only as strong as its people. My highest priority will always be to invest in you and the team. You will do your best work when you are happy, safe, and challenged. The most rewarding parts of my job is to understand your ["hoodie"](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/managing-nerds/) plus your ["cave"](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/a-nerd-in-a-cave/) and provide it.
- _Everyone matter_ - This can be taken many ways. Our customers matter, and they should be our guiding star. Our teammates matter, and we should strive to learn from them as well as show up for them. The rest of the company matters, and we should always be aware of how our decisions may affect them. Lastly, you matter. Always make sure to take time for yourself. That can mean personal development initiatives, time off, or a walk around the park on a beautiful day.
- _Trust & Honesty_ -
- _Always be shipping_ - I think there is compounding value in constantly shipping incremental improvements to our codebase. This can be refactors, optimizations, feature work, or bug fixes. Without shipping constantly, the team loses perceived momentum. This can lead to low morale and creativity.
- _Challenge the Status Quo_ - I hope to never accept a pattern or do something "because that is the way we do things". I expect myself and our team to always be asking "why?". Sometimes the answer is sound and apparent, but this approach will help uncover the times it is not and we will all be better for it. This applies to our code, our team processes, and also organizational structure.
- _This should be fun_ - Like I said before, we do our best work when we are happy. If you are not enjoying your work we should talk about how we can enjoy your work again. Sometimes this could be a new project, new direction, or more learning. It could also be more work from home time or time and space to exercise. Lets figure out what it is for you!
- Leave it better than you found it
- Learning

## My Work Style

### Work/Life Balance and Schedule

- I like to start early. That does not mean I am a morning person ‚òïÔ∏èü•± by any means but it is usually time I find myself uninterrupted. I cherish my time before 10 am every day and try to keep it free if possible. It also does not mean you have to be online early.
- My headphones are usually on. That does not mean I do not want to be disturbed, I happen to work best that way and enjoy music. I may not see you or hear you coming and therefore may be startled. So sometimes a tap on the shoulder could be replaced by a quick slack if you cannot get my attention and I'll be ready to chat in no time.
- Please, please, please take vacation.
- I may work late and infrequently on weekends. I expect you to set your own hours without feeling like you need to work mine. Furthermore, I trust you will get your work done, and can work accordingly.
- Take time at work to pursue things that are interesting to you that may be off our critical path. Let's find time to talk about finding those opportunities for you and the space to pursue them.
- Take vacation, even if it is a day here or there, or an hour in the middle of the day to go for a walk, a run, or get a coffee.

### Communication

My calendar is always up to date. Please add time to it if you would like, I am always happy to meet formally or informally. I attempt to block all my meetings together. This is usually a double edged sword as provides more time to focus, but can leave me fatigued by the end of the day.

When communicating I prefer to use the following mediums in this order:

- In person/Over video - but lets make sure the time is convenient for both of us. If it is not convenient for you I will make sure to find time that fits your schedule or workload.
- In a meeting
- Over slack - I think long slack threads can be helpful for future context, but in the moment decision making or collaboration is best served via a vide call or in person discussion. I strive to take long slack threads and turn them into real conversations with a recap in slack later.

I will do my best to never slack/email you after working hours or over the weekend. If I do, please do not feel pressure to respond. I know that is a tall ask, because I would feel that pressure. However, I do mean it and will strive to not put you in that situation.

### How I like to Collaborate

- I find a great joy in brainstorming a solution together. It can be exhilarating to come to a realization at the same time or watch the light bulb go on for someone else. However, when the lightbulb goes on for me, I may get lost in my thoughts. Ask me to come back to Earth, slow down, and explain.
- I always want to pair program more, and am happy to drive or come along for the ride. I also love pairing with different levels of engineers. I always find I learn something when I am pairing no matter if the person is more senior or more junior. It can be new syntax, a workflow technique, a tool or application, something about them , or a software pattern I haven't encountered before.
- Code review as an educational tool. Similarly to pair programming, I believe code review should be done by all levels of engineers and always results in leveling up both parties. These areas of learning are not always code, it can be mentorship, communication, and leadership as well!

### How I make Decisions

I like to make everyone happy. This can be difficult when making decisions. I understand that I cannot make everyone happy at all times, and in attempting to do so this can do more harm than good. That being said I do try to ensure that Io weigh the costs and benefits to all parties involved. It can also lead to me taking a little bit longer to make decisions, it is also something I am working on.

## What makes Andrew Andrew

### Pet peeves

- I prefer action to talking. I've been in too many meetings that do not provide value. There is a time and a place to debate potential directions or approaches but I bias towards figuring something out by doing. I will do my best
- Complacency
- Negative comments or body language. If something or someone is bothering you lets talk about it. If there is something going on outside of work that is okay! Lets figure out how to balance it with your current responsibilities.

### Things I am Working On

- Once you get to know me, you will call me a liar when I say I am an introvert. However, in larger groups or with people I am not as familiar with I can be quiet and shy. I am doing my best to be more comfortable in these types of situations.
- Balancing planning ahead with the team's current workload and the organizations current priorities. I tend to focus on the now and am working on ensuring the team is always has meaningful work to accomplish.
- See above about decision making.
- I am constantly struggling with an imposter syndrome that is perpetually moving my set of goal posts. While I don't know if this will go away, it is getting better.
- My typing skills. My school district growing up voted for budget cuts and the typing program went. I'm working on it I promise.
- Use of the words "obviously" and "just". Not everything is obvious to everyone and the word "just" can belittle the significance of an action or event for someone.
- Not eating as many skittles
- There will be times where I go heads down and work on tasks that might tedious or uninteresting. Currently, I think it is helpful for me to handle this work to shield the team and provide them their cave. Ultimately that is wrong and could eventually be detrimental, which is why it is an area of improvement.

### Etc

- I grew up outside of Boston, went to school in central PA (where i wanted to be a doctor üò¨), worked in the Northest Kingdom of New Hampshire, and now live in New York. My family is usually in Texas or Rhode Island and my wife's family is from New Jersey. Hopefully this explains something about me.
- I like to use vim but also VS Code
- More often than not I'd like to be surfing
- have you heard of EmberJS üôÉüêπ
